         Have you ever find yourself wandering through the museums rooms
         without really paying attention to any historical or cultural aspects 
         of the paintings you are looking at?
         Did you ever just started looking around at other people as this seemed 
         more interesting than the paintings themselves?
         If so, this is the right place for you to gain some background to better 
         understand what you are actually observing on the canvas! 
        </p>
